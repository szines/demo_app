## Web API's Assignment

Build a site which dynamically collates a set of information on a specific topic. Whilst the topic itself can be anything you are personally interested in, the sources of the content should be drawn from the major social networks you have studied in this course. Facebook content should be requested dynamically via the Facebook API using the relevant query and markup languages. Twitter content should load dynamically via the Twitter API and should pull content from more than one API endpoint (eg, Search, List or Retweets). Users of your site who choose to login with their own social network accounts will be able to comment or share the material.
Specific Instructions:
Your application should gather together a selection of content from both of your social networks (but obviously in individual apps!) and display them together in one set. You should provide a method for your users to login via one of their own social networks. Logged in users will have elevated permissions, allowing them to further share the content.
Please consider the following when preparing your submission:
You will need to create a selection of social network accounts and add content to them in order to complete this assignment.
Please ensure that you have the following when handing up your work:
A cover page that states all relevant information including your stream, module, your name, your contact email address and your telephone number
REMEMBER THAT FACEBOOK NEEDS TO KNOW WHERE YOUR APP IS RUNNING.  PLEASE MAKE A NOTE SOMEWHERE TO LET ME KNOW THE PATH THAT YOUR APP SHOULD BE USING.  YOU SHOULD SET THIS IN YOUR FB TOKENS FILE:
The CRAWDESK_V5 lab is a good starting point for this assignment - but remember to remove the local database code as you are only interested in social login for this assignment.
